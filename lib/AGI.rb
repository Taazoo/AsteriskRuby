The AGI object can be used to interact with an Asterisk. It can be used within the AGIServer framework, or independantly. Simply instantiate an AGI object and pass it input and output IO objects. Asterisk extensions can exec an agi script (in asterisk parlance, agi or deadagi), in which case you'll want to use stdin and stdout, or asterisk extensions can connect to a daemonized agi server (in asterisk parlance, fagi) and you'd want to use a tcp socket.

  agi = AGI.new(:input => STDIN, :output => STDOUT)
  agi.init
  agi.answer
  agi.hangup

Note, all agi instances will be uninitialized. The initialization process of an agi channel must be performed before any other interaction with the channel can be accomplished.

#AGI is the Asterisk Gateway Interface, an interface for adding functionality to asterisk. This class implements an object that knows the AGI language and can therefore serve as a bridge between ruby and Asterisk. It can interact with any IO object it's given, so can be used in a sockets based FastAGI or a simple STDIN/STDOUT based Fork-Exec'd AGI. Please see {The Voip Info Asterisk AGI site}[http://www.voip-info.org/wiki-Asterisk+AGI] for more details.
